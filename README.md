# NVIDIA Stock Price Prediction
This project involves predicting the stock prices of NVIDIA using various Machine Learning models. It employs techniques such as data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation, using a combination of libraries for data analysis, visualization, and model building.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following key components:

- `Prediction.ipynb`: The main notebook where the data is loaded, processed, and used for training models.
- `nvidia_stock_prices.csv`: A dataset containing historical stock prices of NVIDIA, used for model training and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing the Python dependencies required to run this project.

## Libraries Used
To run this project, the following Python libraries are required:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- plotly
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- IPython
- ipykernel

## Usage
1. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Load the dataset `(nvidia_stock_prices.csv)` and execute the notebook cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and visualize predictions.

## Results
After running the notebook, you will see visualizations of NVIDIA stock price trends and model predictions. The final model is evaluated based on accuracy and error metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R Squared.
